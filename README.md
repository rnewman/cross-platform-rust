# cross-platform-rust

This is an example project showing a Rust library building for and running on multiple platforms.

If you want to create a simple Rust library that passes primitives to calling code on both iOS and Android, check out the `basic` project.

If you want to create a Rust library that passes more complex objects, check out the `complex objects` project.

You can read the blog posts for which this is an example:

- [Android](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-browser-architecture/experiments/2017-09-21-rust-on-android.html)
